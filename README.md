# rick-and-morty-api

I built this project to try and learn how to use Vue JS with Typescript. I used the Rick and Morty API - rickandmortyapi.com. I used the VS Code extension 'Paste JSON as Code' to help type the fetch response.

The project fetches all the Rick characters from the series and includes a search bar to search by name and filters for the status of the character.

## Tech Stack
